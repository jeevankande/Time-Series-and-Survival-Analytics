Time series forecasting occurs when you make scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. It involves building models through historical analysis and using them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making. An important distinction in forecasting is that at the time of the work, the future outcome is completely unavailable and can only be estimated through careful analysis and evidence-based priors.
word frequencies in different documents play a key role in extracting the latent topics. LSA tries to extract the dimensions using a machine learning algorithm called Singular Value Decomposition or SVD.
Besides, time series forecasting has enormous commercial significance because stuff that is important to a business like demand and sales, number of visitors to a website, stock price etc are essentially time series data.
Time series analysis involves understanding various aspects about the inherent nature of the series so that you are better informed to create meaningful and accurate forecasts.
